# Pewlett_Hacakard_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

This analysis we are taking csv files that are for an employee database and create new tables in PostgreSQL to see who is retiring and their titles in the company. Also, we are seeing if there are employees that are eligible for an employee mentorship program to potentially fill out these positions and get potentially trained. 

## Results: 

1. One of the major points we see that there are many people that are close to retiring. There are around 90,000+ that are retiring So, the positions will need to be filled soon.

2. Also based on the image above on we can see there are many major titles that look like they may need to be filled. Some of the big titles that need to be filled are Senior Engineer which has 29,414, Senior Staff which has 28,254, Engineer 14,222, and Staff 12,243. These are showing over 10,000 positions that need filled.

3. Deliverable 2 shows us there are employees that are eligible to be in the mentorship program. This will allow us to fill in these positions in house before looking outside of the company.

4. We need to take advantage of the eligible mentorship program for people to be trained in these roles so they can be filled so we can lessen the amount of hiring that we need to do once the potentially people who can retire, retire.

## Summary:

-	When looking at the retiring titles there are over 90,000 roles that are potentially going to be needed to fill. This is an exceptionally large number and will potentially hurt the company if they are not filled soon or have someone in place to take the position. 

-	There are 15,492 people that are eligible for the mentorship program. With the 90,000 people that are retiring soon there are enough people to train those who are eligible for the mentorship this will allow us to be able to fill the positions as they come up.

-	We can create more query tables to try and see if we can have more people that can qualify the position. One way is to create a table where we do not go by their birthdate, but create a query by how long they have been in the position they are currently in. There may be some candidates that are younger in age but have enough experience in their current position to fill the role that is going to open. Also, we can create a table to see how close the retirees are to retiring. If we know the age that people can retire, we can get the specific amount of people that are almost guaranteed to retire and fill those position first.
